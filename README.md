# Screeps

My code for the game Screeps.

Coded until controller level 5 and working well with many rooms.

## Model

* _main_ executes code, tools and director
* _director_ will orchestrate and run the architect, manager and general
* _architect_ to automatically generate construction sites
* _manager_ to recruit and manage worker creeps and resource buildings
* _general_ to recruit and command soldier creeps and defense
